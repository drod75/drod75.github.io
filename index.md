## **Introduction** 

Hello, I'm **David Rodriguez**!

Iâ€™m currently a third-year student at **Brooklyn College**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science** and a minor in **Data Science**. My academic journey is complemented by my active participation in the 10th cohort of CUNY Tech Prep, where Iâ€™m honing my skills and deepening my understanding of the tech industry, along with this I was a mentee in the Brooklyn College BLMI Mentor Collective.

Iâ€™m driven by a passion for innovation and a keen interest in exploring new opportunities. I thrive on participating in diverse projects and learning from different experiences. Recently, I had the pleasure of contributing to two short podcasts, where in one I discussed topics that revolved around recent events in nerd culture.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects Iâ€™ve been working on and learn more about my journey. Iâ€™m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new possibilities!
