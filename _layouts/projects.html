                CUNY provides resources to address students’ mental health, food insecurity, housing instability,
                and other basic needs in order for learning to thrive. Given that CUNY has developed ways to 
                address these issues, the University wants to ensure students are aware of the availability
                and means to access these crucial resources and services. Although numerous resources exist, such as
                food pantries, counseling centers, and referral sources, many eligible students do not utilize 
                them to their full potential. The primary objective of all hackers is to answer the following question: 
                How can CUNY increase awareness through digital and mobile outlets and ultimately increase 
                usage of essential resources to meet students’ “essential needs”?

                The Stack Overflow Developer Survey aims to find out more about developers, and their 
                favorite tools as well as languages. The problem this survey faces is the various backgrounds 
                of the people who answered the survey, as well as any common trends in the tech industry 
                that are important to highlight. This can range from anything gender related, to even any 
                tool problem that is being unnoticed that can be highlighted by the survey. The questions that 
                are being asked are ones that range across a person's background in tech, so their favorite 
                languages, databases, and which ones they want to learn. Some other questions are also what are 
                a person's gender, education level, country, and of course gender.

                and consists of using various python apis such as pandas, jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, searborn, tensorflow, and scikit learn.
                The homework every week tests ones dedication to Data Science and making sure they keep on putting to work the skills
                and tools a Data Scientist in all fields would use, thank you to CUNY Tech prep for some great work!

                The homework mainly consists of 3115 which is java homework, 3220 which is some varying OS related
                homework, and 1215 consists of python homework. Thank you and please do not copy the homework if
