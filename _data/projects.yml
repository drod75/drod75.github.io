    Architected and optimized an end-to-end ML pipeline for the "Blind Spot" application, capturing real-time camera
    frames, preprocessing images with OpenCV, encoding them via base64, and feeding into a Google Gemini-powered
    LangChain model wrapped in Pydantic schemas, achieving sub-second inference latency and 95% uptime in production.

    Implemented a classification model by using Tensorflow with around a 70 percent success rate to perform food
    classification in order to inform users of what it is they are eating from a database of a variety of foods found most
    common in the United States.
