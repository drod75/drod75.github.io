    The project aims to use machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze food images and
    identify them. By using diverse datasets, the model will learn to recognize dishes based on visual
    features. Our project aims to inform users about what it is they are eating, including potential
    nutritional value and an AI generated response on how their dish might have been prepared. We want
    users to have an easy way to figure out what their favorite foods contain, to know any allergens in the
    food and to better connect to the food around them. This tool can also tell users the calories of their
    dish, they can figure out the nutrients with only a few steps!

    CUNY provides resources to address students’ mental health, food insecurity, housing instability,
    and other basic needs in order for learning to thrive. Given that CUNY has developed ways to
    address these issues, the University wants to ensure students are aware of the availability
    and means to access these crucial resources and services. Although numerous resources exist, such as
    food pantries, counseling centers, and referral sources, many eligible students do not utilize
    them to their full potential. The primary objective of all hackers is to answer the following question:
    How can CUNY increase awareness through digital and mobile outlets and ultimately increase
    usage of essential resources to meet students’ “essential needs”?

    Hack Knight is a dynamic gathering of creative minds and tech enthusiasts where participants
    collaborate intensively on projects, competing for certificates and recognition. Our event serves
    as a catalyst for innovation, fostering connections and driving forward-thinking solutions.
    We are also using this event to segway into bigger hackathons for Queens College students, and would
    love CS QC student support on this event!

    The Stack Overflow Developer Survey aims to find out more about developers, and their
    favorite tools as well as languages. The problem this survey faces is the various backgrounds
    of the people who answered the survey, as well as any common trends in the tech industry
    that are important to highlight. This can range from anything gender related, to even any
    tool problem that is being unnoticed that can be highlighted by the survey. The questions that
    are being asked are ones that range across a person's background in tech, so their favorite
    languages, databases, and which ones they want to learn. Some other questions are also what are
    a person's gender, education level, country, and of course gender.

    This link leads to a github repositories that aims to provide readers on the MTA and the various
    lines that it consists of, this includes analyzing ridership and looking at how each borough interacts
    with the MTA as a whole. Currently this repo has a line map, various heat maps you can choose from,
    and a view of the Data I use which is from the MTA itself thanks to its open data initiative.

    This link leads to a github repository where I work on my CUNY Tech Prep homework, the homework is from the
    Data Science track
    and consists of using various python apis such as pandas, jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, searborn, tensorflow,
    and scikit learn.
    The homework every week tests ones dedication to Data Science and making sure they keep on putting to work the
    skills
    and tools a Data Scientist in all fields would use, thank you to CUNY Tech prep for some great work!

    homework down from my Computer Science classes, among these are the courses 1215, 3220, and 3115.
    The homework mainly consists of 3115 which is java homework, 3220 which is some varying OS related
    homework, and 1215 consists of python homework. Thank you and please do not copy the homework if
    you are taking the classes, have a nice day!
