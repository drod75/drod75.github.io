  description:
    - Architected and optimized an end-to-end ML pipeline for the "Blind Spot" application, capturing real-time camera frames, preprocessing images with OpenCV, encoding them via base64, and feeding into a Google Gemini-powered LangChain model wrapped in Pydantic schemas, achieving sub-second inference latency and 95% uptime in production.
    - Engineered and containerized a scalable Flask/Gunicorn backend on AWS EC2 and Render, automating model loading, environment configuration with python-dotenv, and continuous deployment, while implementing request-level caching, history-aware prompts, and secure API-key enforcement to support concurrent users.

  description:
    - Implemented a classification model by using Tensorflow with around a 70 percent success rate to perform food classification in order to inform users of what it is they are eating from a database of a variety of foods found most common in the United States.
    - Trained the model with a database over 100 classes with a total of 100,000 images, trained the model on a variety of data implementing advanced training techniques to ensure the model was accurate and acceptable.
    - Applied a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) inside the application tied to a database of thousands of authentic recipes to provide users with recipes based on their query, combined 2 features to create a system of classification and Al and data driven creation.
