introduction: |
  Hello, I'm **David Rodriguez**!

  I’m currently a third-year student at **Brooklyn College**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science** and a minor in **Data Science**. My academic journey is complemented by my active participation in the 10th cohort of CUNY Tech Prep, where I’m honing my skills and deepening my understanding of the tech industry, along with this I was a mentee in the Brooklyn College BLMI Mentor Collective.

  I’m driven by a passion for innovation and a keen interest in exploring new opportunities, I thrive on participating in diverse projects and learning from different experiences. Some opportunities I have been lucky to participate in include CUNY Tech Prep, Brooklyn College's Undergraduate Student Government, Brooklyn College's Black and Latino Male Initiative, Codepath, and I regularly attend industry events.

  Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I’ve been working on and learn more about my journey. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new possibilities!
