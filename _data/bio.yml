introduction: |
  Greetings, my name is *David Rodriguez*, I am a Senior at Brooklyn College, my Major is Computer Science,my Minor is Data Science, and in my spare time I am an active member at my college via my College's Student Government.
  To touch on my Computer Science / Data Science skills, I am Alumni of CUNY Tech Prep via the Data Science track, I have taken a technical interview prep course from Codepath, and built several AI Projects. To touch on two of the projects I have worked on, via a team of 3 worked on a Food Clasification Model that was leveraged with an AI Rag System, and in another project the team I was a part of worked on an AI Vision Application aimed at letting blind people see via audio descriptions.
  In terms of soft skills, I am always looking to try new things and a few of the things I have worked on because of this are, a council member at one my colleges student government groups, an elected student senator, and I have helped in evetns both in and out of the school. I am always working in some sort of team and am always willing to adjust to new circumstances and roles.
  Thank you for reading and I hope we can connect!
