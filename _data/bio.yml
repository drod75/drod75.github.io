introduction: |
  I'm David Rodriguez, a Computer Science and Data Science student at Brooklyn College. I'm passionate about building AI-powered applications and have experience developing projects like an AI vision application for the visually impaired and a food classification model. With over a year of experience in student government, I've developed strong leadership and teamwork skills. I'm a CUNY Tech Prep and Codepath alum, always eager to learn and apply my skills to new challenges.
